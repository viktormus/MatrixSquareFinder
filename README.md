# MatrixSquareFinder
Developing a dynamic programming solution by myself and documenting my thinking throughout the entire process (in Finnish)

Problem:

We are given a matrix of size m x n, where each element is either 0 or 1. For example:

0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0

The goal is to find a largest square within the matrix, where each element is a 1. In the example above, there is a 2x2 square in the upper right corner, which is the solution. If there are multiple squares of same size, any of them counts as a solution.
